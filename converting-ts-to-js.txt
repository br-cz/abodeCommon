We want to convert TS into JS to make it generally compatible, hence:
-we make a build command in package.json
-uncomment declaration in tsconfig to make a type def file
-uncomment outdir and change path to ./build so it generates a folder called build filled with converted js code
-install del cli to clean the build directory to get a fresh build
